# 🧾 Final EDA Report for Shopify Sales Data

---

## 📌 Dataset Summary

* **Total Records**: 7,431
* **Total Features**: 19 (original), later expanded after feature engineering
* **Data Source**: Shopify Sales Excel file

---

## 🧹 Step 1: Data Overview

* **No duplicate rows** found.
* **Missing values**:

  * `Product Id`: 11 missing
  * `Variant Id`: 4 missing
* **All key numerical and categorical columns properly typed**
* **Datetime column `Invoice Date` converted** to proper datetime format

---

## 🛠️ Step 2: Data Cleaning

* Combined `Billing Address First Name` and `Last Name` into `Full Name`
* Normalized city names using `.capitalize()`
* Removed missing values or imputed if necessary
* Verified and dropped 0 zero-value rows in Quantity/Price/Tax

---

## 📊 Step 3: Univariate Analysis

* **Numerical Summary**:

  * Most orders have **Quantity = 1**
  * Prices (Subtotal/Total) are **right-skewed** — few high-value outliers
* **Boxplots & Histograms**:

  * Outliers confirmed in price and tax columns
  * Concentration in low price ranges
* **Categorical Summary**:

  * Most sales from **United States**
  * **USD** is the dominant currency
  * **Shopify Payments** is the most used gateway
  * Few dominant product types

---

## 🔗 Step 4: Bivariate Analysis

* **Correlation Matrix**:

  * `Subtotal Price`, `Total Price Usd`, and `Total Tax` are perfectly correlated (r = 1.00)
  * `Quantity` has a moderate positive correlation with other price-based fields
* **Scatter Plots**:

  * Showed strong linearity between price-related columns
  * Quantity has a **non-linear** relationship with price
* **Boxplots (Categorical vs Numerical)**:

  * Certain product types have consistently higher values

## 🧠 Key Business Insights

1. ✅ Most orders are **small, single-item** purchases
2. ✅ **High-value transactions** are rare but significantly impact revenue
3. ✅ Business is **geographically concentrated** (mainly U.S. customers)
4. ✅ Revenue is **driven by few product types** and gateways
5. ✅ **Tax and Total Price** are strongly tied — tax likely a fixed percentage

---

## 🔧 Step 5: Handling Missing & Duplicate Data

* 11 missing values in `Product Id`, 4 in `Variant Id` — handled
* **0 duplicate rows**
* No zero-values in `Quantity`, `Price`, or `Tax` columns

---

## 🏗️ Step 6: Feature Engineering

New features created:

* 📅 `Year`, `Month`, `Weekday`, `Hour` — extracted from `Invoice Date`
* 💸 `Revenue per Unit` = `Total Price / Quantity`
* 🚨 `High Tax Order` = if tax > 95th percentile
* 📈 `Revenue Category` = segmented into bins: Very Low → Very High
* 🌍 `Country_Product` = combined location + product type

---

## 🔄 Step 7: Encoding & Transformation

* **Label Encoding** applied to binary categories
* **One-Hot Encoding** used for multi-class variables (e.g., product type, city)
* **Min-Max Scaling** done for numerical features
* Final dataset shape: **(7431, 27211 columns)** after one-hot encoding

---

## 🧪 Step 8: Correlation & Feature Selection

* Identified highly correlated pairs:

  * `Total Price` \~ `Subtotal Price` \~ `Total Tax`
  * `Product Id` \~ `Variant Id`
* Final cleaned dataset exported to `Cleaned_Shopify_Sales.csv`

## 📦 Final Output Ready For:

✅ Machine Learning
✅ Dashboards (Power BI/Tableau)
✅ Reporting & Decision Making
✅ Portfolio Projects
